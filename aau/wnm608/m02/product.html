		<h2>What we know now…</h2>
		<p>The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid device: half-portable, half-living room system. It will seamlessly “switch” from home theater console gaming to portable tablet gaming.</p>
		<p>It goes from TV console (when it is docked) to a hand held gaming system like the Game Boy – just a load bigger!! The docking station connects to your big TV, so you just dock the console to “switch” the game to the TV and pick it up off the dock when you want to play via the Tablet style screen.</p>
		<p>It’s sliding controllers are called Joy-Cons, they slide onto a battery pack for large controller, you can use a separate Bluetooth Pro Controller (like Xbox controller), available for around $70. You can also use the Joy-Cons separately for multiplayer experiences.</p>

		<h2>So what games are available for the Switch?</h2>
		<p>L80 Games are currently in development, only a handful will be available on March 3rd 2017.</p>
		<p>Remarkably, Nintendo are making the device software region free, which means we can play Japanese games for the 1st time in the US!</p>

		<p>No longer called the Nintendo NX (but I liked that name), Nintendo has announced that their new system is called the Nintendo Switch. Thanks to the short but fantastic trailer, we now see how the system will work and is true to the original rumors that system is a hybrid of sorts.</p>
        <p>We still don’t know much about the hardware just yet, but we did see that in the trailer that it does use some sort of flash cart for on the go gaming.  We still don’t know much about the hardware just yet, but we did see that in the trailer that it does use some sort of flash cart for on the go gaming. It also looks like that the mobile / portable portion of the system is less powerful than the home portion, requiring the use of the dock to get increased graphical power. Sort of how laptops can use attachable GPU’s now. </p>
