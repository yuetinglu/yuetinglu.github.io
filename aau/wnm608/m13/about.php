				   <p>About</p>
					<p>This project presents a series of landscape paintings that depict the California coastline. This idea was inspired when I took a trip along California State Route 1. I later returned to the seaside along the California coastline for many times and fell in love with its beauty. To the coastline’s beauty, I focused on an expressive realistic representation of the coast. I used palette knives to create different textures for the surface of cliffs, sands and seawater. The project shows costal views from various vantage points and emphasizes its cliffs, beaches and bridges, under various weather conditions.</p>
 	            	<p>After numerous visiting to the coast, doing sketches and taking photo references, I finally finished the project, which includes fourteen paintings ranging in size from 11×14 to 18×24 inches.</p>
