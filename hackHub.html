          A hackathon is a gathering where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over a short period of time. Hackathons are at least a few days - or over a weekend - and generally no longer than a week. While working on a particular project, the idea is for each developer to have the ability and freedom to work on whatever he/she wants. </br>
          A hackathon is also known as a hackfest or hack day.

        Nowadays, there are many tech hackathson events. While almost all those events only provide information like the topic of an event, how many people signed up, what time will it be held and how long an event will be last. <br>
        These events are general enough for most meetup events. While, for hackathon, those may not be enough. 
        For most hackathsons, people want to be together with others who have complementary skills. So people have different skills can group up and do some awesome projects. Only in this way, can people make the most of each person’s skill and thus have the optimal result.<br>
        For event holders, their expectation is to make the most use of people’s talent and find the next interesting project and find the next potential business. <br>
        No matter participants or organizers will need such a platform that can make the process of grouping optimal.

        Here are some other types of people that make hackathons successful: <br>
        Designers: Everyone knows that engineers aren’t always the best designers. Designers bring creativity, vision, and user experience to a hack. A hackathon with a lot of designers brings a special sense of style and art to the event.<br>
        Business minds: A small percentage of hackathon projects become actual products, and one reason is that when they are being created, no one thinks of a business plan. Biz dev folks add value to hackathons, almost as the devil’s advocate, to test and challenge an idea.<br>
        Marketing sharks/product ninjas: You need to be realistic about what you’re building, and make sure it would be a usable product. These creative minds will help balance out a successful team at a hackathon.<br>
        Recruiters: Only rockstars attend hackathons. If you can build a lucrative startup in 24 hours with complete strangers, you can work just about anywhere. A good percentage of hackathon attendees don’t have regular weekday jobs. Recruiters also add value because they help break the ice between many personalities.

          Hackathons are proving grounds for new ideas. They’re especially good tools to stimulate the creative and problem-solving juices of developers. Unlike their day jobs where risk-taking may be frowned upon, in a hackathon there is a low cost of failure. <br>
          The time limit in a hackathon forces participants to distil their visionary concepts down to actionable solutions.<br>
          Outsiders can bring a fresh perspective to business challenges, as well as give an outside-in view of products and organization. Engaging with participants during the hackathon is an excellent way to get feedback on a recently released API: learn where developers get stuck, what they love and what suggestions for improvement they have. <br>
